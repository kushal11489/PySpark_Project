* R2 value shows how much variance is explained by your model

* RMSE value shows the error in the absolute value of labelled column. After calculating RMSE,
compare it with the Mean of labelled column to check how effective the model is.

* BinaryClassificationEvaluator helps to get area under ROC curve. More the area close to 1, more is the accuracy of the model
